# Football Minutes - User Guide

Quick guide for coaches managing youth football teams.

## What This App Does

Automatically generates fair playing time allocations across 4 quarters, ensuring every player gets equal minutes and everyone plays in goal at least once.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign In

Use your credentials to log in. Contact your team admin if you don't have an account yet.

### 2. Add Your Players

**Management Tab → Player Roster Management**

- Add all players who might turn up this season
- You can add, edit, or remove players any time
- Players you remove can be restored later if needed

## Creating a Match

### Step 1: Match Setup

1. Go to **Next Match** tab
2. Enter match details:
   - Date (required)
   - Kickoff time (optional)
   - Venue (Home/Away/Neutral)
   - Opponent name (required)
3. Click **Continue to Player Selection**

### Step 2: Select Your Squad

- Tick the players who are available for this specific match
- You need 5-15 players to generate an allocation
- The system accounts for who's actually playing, not your full roster

### Step 3: Set Goalkeepers (Optional)

If you want specific players in goal for specific quarters, use **Manual GK Selection**.

Otherwise, leave it on "Auto" and the system will rotate fairly.

### Step 4: Generate Allocation

Click **Generate Allocation**.

The system creates a quarter-by-quarter lineup ensuring:
- Everyone plays roughly equal minutes
- Everyone does at least one quarter in goal
- GKs get outfield time too
- No player sits out more than necessary

### Step 5: Review and Adjust

You'll see:
- **Allocation Grid**: Who plays where in each quarter
- **Player Summary**: Total minutes per player

If you need to tweak:
- Click any slot to edit player or position
- Drag and drop players between slots or quarters
- Changes recalculate automatically

### Step 6: Confirm and Save

Click **Confirm Team**.

You can also add match results here (optional):
- Score
- Goalscorers
- Player of the Match
- Honourable Mentions

Click **Save Match**.

### Post-Save

You'll see a clean summary of your saved match with two options:

- **View Season Stats** - See all your matches and player statistics

### After the Match

A: Go to Management → Rules Engine and change the settings.

**Q: How do I see who's played the most minutes?**
A: Season Stats → Player Statistics → click the "Total Minutes" header to sort.

**Q: I made a mistake. Can I delete a match?**
A: Yes. Go to Season Stats → expand the match → click Delete. Confirm when prompted.

**Q: Can multiple coaches use this?**
